**Hi!**

I'm a Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong advised by [Prof. Qiang Xu](https://cure-lab.github.io/).

Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence from Shanghai Jiao Tong University where I worked closely with [Prof. Guanjie Zheng](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~gjzheng/index.html).

Please visit [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O-xoSwUAAAAJ&hl=en) for my publications and more.
